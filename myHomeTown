My home-town is Thrissur.
It is the 4th largest city in Kerala.
The City is built around a 65-acre (26 ha) hillock called the Thekkinkadu Maidan which seats the Vadakkumnathan temple. 
Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin.
 It is located 300 kilometres (186 mi) towards north-west of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram.
